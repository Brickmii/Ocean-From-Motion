  <h1 class="page-title">Chapter 2: Polarity</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Polarity – Opposing Motion</p>
  <h2><strong>1. Abstract — Polarity as Primitive Opposition</strong></h2>
<p>Polarity is introduced in the Motion Calendar as the second primitive motion function, arising necessarily from heat but introducing no structure beyond opposition. Where heat establishes the existence and magnitude of motion, polarity establishes that motion may exist in mutually opposed forms. Polarity does not encode direction, orientation, causality, or spatial relation; it encodes only distinguishability through opposition.</p>
<p>Formally, polarity partitions heat magnitude into two preserved, non-reducible motion classes, conventionally denoted as positive and negative. These classes are not vectors, forces, or flows, and they do not imply interaction or balance. They represent the minimal condition under which difference can exist without structure: motion that is the same in magnitude yet opposite in kind.</p>
<p>Polarity is not derivable from spatial axes, temporal ordering, or energetic gradients. Rather, those higher-order constructs presuppose polarity as a prerequisite for asymmetry, contrast, and separation. Without polarity, all motion remains undifferentiated magnitude; with polarity, motion becomes classifiable without becoming directional.</p>
<p>This function establishes the logical foundation for preservation, symmetry, and opposition in later motion functions, while remaining ontologically minimal. Polarity answers the second foundational question of motion: not how motion moves, but how motion can differ.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Introduction – Why Motion requires Polarity</strong></h2>
<p>Heat establishes that motion exists and in what quantity, but heat alone is insufficient to support distinction. A system composed solely of undifferentiated heat magnitude admits only accumulation; it cannot support contrast, asymmetry, or preservation across classes. In such a system, all motion is identical up to magnitude, and no meaningful differentiation is possible.</p>
<p>Polarity is therefore required as the minimal refinement of motion that permits difference without structure. It introduces the possibility that two motions may be equal in magnitude yet opposed in kind, without implying interaction, cancellation, or spatial relation. This opposition is not relational in the geometric or causal sense; it is classificatory in the ontological sense. Importantly, polarity is not introduced to explain dynamics, forces, or equilibria.</p>
<p>Those are higher-order constructions. Polarity exists prior to any notion of direction, orientation, persistence, or time. It does not answer how motion propagates or where it resides, only that motion may exist in mutually opposed forms.</p>
<p>Without polarity, preservation statements cannot be meaningfully stated, as there is nothing to preserve <em>across</em>. Without polarity, symmetry cannot be broken, because no opposed states exist to distinguish symmetry from uniformity. Polarity thus provides the minimal logical substrate upon which later motion functions—existence, righteousness, order, and movement—can operate.</p>
<p>In this sense, polarity is not an optional enrichment of heat, but a necessary condition for structured motion. It answers a question heat cannot: not whether motion exists, but how motion can differ while remaining fundamentally the same.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Algebra of Polarity</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>3.1 Polarity Space</strong></h2>
<p>Heat magnitude is defined over the non-negative reals:</p>
<p>Where  is the heat index and  is the heat constant.</p>
<p>Polarity refines heat by introducing an opposition label:</p>
<p>A <strong>polar motion unit</strong> is defined as the ordered pair:</p>
<p>Here, 𝜅 represents motion magnitude, and σ represents polarity class only. The polarity label has no numerical value and no geometric interpretation.</p>
<p>Define the projection maps:</p>
<h2><strong>3.2 Embedding of Heat into Polarity</strong></h2>
<p>Heat embeds into polarity without alteration of magnitude:</p>
<p>This embedding is non-unique by design. Heat does not determine polarity; polarity is an independent refinement that preserves heat magnitude while introducing opposition. Here,  denotes a canonical embedding of heat into polarity, not an identity operator; it preserves magnitude while introducing an opposition class of motion.</p>
<h2><strong>3.3 Polarity Involution</strong></h2>
<p>Define the <strong>polarity inversion operator</strong>:</p>
<p>With,</p>
<p>Axioms:</p>
<p>This involution encodes opposition without implying negation, subtraction, or reversal in any directional sense.</p>
<h2><strong>3.4 Composition of Polar Motions</strong></h2>
<p>Polarity admits composition only in ways that preserve heat additivity while avoiding cancellation or resultant direction.</p>
<h3><strong>3.4.1 Same-Polarity Composition</strong></h3>
<p>For polar motions of identical class, define:</p>
<p>This operation is <strong>partial</strong> and defined if and only if the polarity classes match. It preserves both magnitude additivity and polarity identity.</p>
<h3><strong>3.4.2 General Union Composition</strong></h3>
<p>To compose polar motions of arbitrary class without introducing cancellation, define a three-valued polarity set:</p>
<p>where ± denotes the presence of both polarity classes.</p>
<p>Define the union operator:</p>
<p>with polarity combination rule:</p>
<p>This operation preserves total magnitude while recording polarity presence without resolving it into a net value.</p>
<h2><strong>3.5 Preservation Under Polarity</strong></h2>
<p>Polarity refines heat without altering its preservation of magnitude:</p>
<p>Preservation applies to magnitude only. Polarity tracks opposition, not balance.</p>
<h2><strong>3.6 Forbidden Operations</strong></h2>
<p>To prevent the introduction of higher-order structure, the following operations are explicitly undefined in polarity algebra:</p>
<p>Subtraction or cancellation between opposite polarities</p>
<p>Scalar multiplication acting on polarity labels</p>
<p>Any mapping that treats polarity as numerical sign</p>
<p>Any operation yielding a single resultant polarity from opposed classes</p>
<p>These exclusions are axiomatic and essential to preserving polarity as a pre-directional, pre-causal motion function.</p>
<h2><strong>3.7 Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Polarity algebra extends heat by introducing a preserved opposition class with minimal structure: a binary label and an involutive symmetry. This structure supports distinction and conservation without direction, interaction, or temporal interpretation. Polarity therefore enables asymmetry in classification while remaining strictly non-spatial, non-temporal, and non-causal.</p>
<p>However, polarity alone does not determine whether an opposed motion is instantiated. A polarity class may be defined and conserved without ever being present, absent, or transitioning. Heat quantifies motion, and polarity distinguishes it, but neither establishes whether motion <em>exists</em> at any given moment. The question of instantiation remains unresolved.</p>
<p>This limitation motivates the introduction of <strong>existence</strong> as a distinct motion function. Existence assigns temporal state—present, absent, or transitioning—without imposing order, persistence, or causal structure. In doing so, it completes the minimal conditions under which quantified and opposed motion may be said to occur at all, while preserving the foundational separation between magnitude, opposition, and time.</p>
