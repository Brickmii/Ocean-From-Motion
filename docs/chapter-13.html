  <p class="subtitle">Coercion as Forced Motion — The Structure of Violation</p>
  <h2><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>Coercion is commonly understood as forcing someone to act against their will. Within the Motion Calendar, coercion is formalized as forced motion: the imposition of configuration change on an agent without that agent&#x27;s evaluative alignment. Coercion occurs when one agent causes another to traverse a path that the second agent&#x27;s righteousness frame does not select.</p>
<p>This paper analyzes coercion as the paradigm violation of agency maintenance. Coercion does not destroy identity (that would be violence, a different violation) nor does it directly block growth (that would be deprivation). Coercion specifically attacks agency: it forces motion without evaluation, selection without choice, path traversal without consent.</p>
<p>The framework reveals the structural mechanics of coercion: how it operates through heat asymmetry, how it corrupts the coerced agent&#x27;s configuration space, and why it is inherently unstable as a coordination strategy. Coercion generates resistance, deformation, and eventual system failure. Its apparent efficiency is short-term; its actual cost is structural degradation.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Introduction — Motion Without Consent</strong></h2>
<p>Every configuration change involves motion. When an agent selects a path through its own agency—evaluating options, weighting them by righteousness, choosing among them—the resulting motion is consensual. The agent moves because the agent, through its own evaluative structure, has determined to move.</p>
<p>Coercion is motion without consent. One agent causes another to traverse a path that the second agent did not select through its own evaluation. The motion occurs, but the selecting agency is external. The coerced agent is moved rather than moving.</p>
<p>This distinction is not merely semantic. Consensual motion reinforces the agent&#x27;s structure—it exercises agency, strengthens evaluative capacity, and enables growth. Coerced motion degrades the agent&#x27;s structure—it bypasses agency, weakens evaluation, and distorts the configuration space through which future growth must occur.</p>
<p>The apparent effectiveness of coercion—its ability to produce immediate configuration change—masks its structural cost. This paper analyzes that cost, showing why coercion is not merely unethical but structurally self-defeating.</p>
<h2><strong>3. The Mechanics of Coercion</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>3.1 Heat Asymmetry</strong></h2>
<p>Coercion requires heat asymmetry. The coercer must possess sufficient heat to impose motion on the coerced agent—to overcome the coerced agent&#x27;s own selection and force a different path. This asymmetry may arise from physical strength, positional advantage, resource control, or structural dominance.</p>
<p>The coercer expends heat to force motion. This expenditure is not free; it draws down the coercer&#x27;s own reserves and diverts energy from the coercer&#x27;s own growth. Coercion is therefore costly even to the coercer, though this cost may be disguised or deferred.</p>
<h2><strong>3.2 Option Elimination</strong></h2>
<p>The primary mechanism of coercion is option elimination. The coercer restructures the coerced agent&#x27;s option space so that only one path remains accessible—the path the coercer desires. This may be accomplished through threat (making other options appear catastrophic), blockade (preventing access to other options), or manipulation (making other options invisible).</p>
<p>When option space is reduced to a single path, agency collapses. The coerced agent no longer selects; it merely traverses the only available route. This is motion, but not agentive motion. The coerced agent has become a conduit for the coercer&#x27;s intention rather than an independent source of selection.</p>
<h2><strong>3.3 Evaluation Bypass</strong></h2>
<p>Even when multiple options nominally remain, coercion may operate by evaluation bypass. The coercer corrupts the coerced agent&#x27;s evaluation process—through deception, manipulation of the righteousness frame, or overwhelming of the evaluative capacity with threat or urgency.</p>
<p>Under evaluation bypass, the coerced agent may appear to choose among options, but the choice does not reflect genuine evaluation. The righteousness frame has been distorted; the differential assessment has been corrupted; the selection does not express the agent&#x27;s actual values.</p>
<h2><strong>3.4 The Coercion Gradient</strong></h2>
<p>Coercion operates along a gradient from mild influence to total domination:</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> offering reasons that the agent may freely evaluate and accept or reject</p>
<p><strong>Pressure:</strong> increasing the cost of non-compliance while leaving choice intact</p>
<p><strong>Manipulation:</strong> distorting evaluation through deception or frame corruption</p>
<p><strong>Threat:</strong> making non-compliance appear catastrophic</p>
<p><strong>Force:</strong> physically eliminating all options except the desired one</p>
<p>Movement along this gradient corresponds to increasing agency violation. Suggestion preserves agency; force eliminates it. Between these extremes, agency is progressively degraded.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Structural Effects of Coercion</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>4.1 Effects on the Coerced</strong></h2>
<p>Coercion deforms the coerced agent&#x27;s structure in predictable ways:</p>
<p><strong>Configuration distortion:</strong> The agent is forced into configurations it would not have chosen, creating structural strain that must be accommodated or corrected.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluative erosion:</strong> Repeated coercion weakens the evaluative capacity. An agent that is never permitted to evaluate and select loses the ability to evaluate and select.</p>
<p><strong>Growth blocking:</strong> Coerced motion does not follow the error-correction pathway; it does not expand configuration space. The coerced agent&#x27;s growth is stunted.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance generation:</strong> Coerced agents develop resistance structures—configurations oriented toward detecting, avoiding, or countering coercion. These structures consume resources that would otherwise support growth.</p>
<h2><strong>4.2 Effects on the Coercer</strong></h2>
<p>Coercion also deforms the coercer&#x27;s structure:</p>
<p><strong>Heat depletion:</strong> Maintaining coercion requires continuous expenditure. The coercer must sustain the heat asymmetry or the coerced agent will revert to its own selection.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation atrophy:</strong> A coercer who relies on force rather than persuasion loses the capacity for genuine coordination. The coercer&#x27;s own evaluative structures atrophy from disuse.</p>
<p><strong>Isolation:</strong> Coercion destroys trust and invites retaliation. The coercer becomes isolated from cooperative relations, dependent on continued dominance.</p>
<h2><strong>4.3 Effects on the System</strong></h2>
<p>At the multi-agent system level, coercion produces:</p>
<p><strong>Reduced total agency:</strong> The system&#x27;s capacity for adaptive response diminishes as coerced agents lose agency and coercers specialize in domination.</p>
<p><strong>Structural fragility:</strong> Coercive configurations are maintained by force rather than alignment. They persist only while the coercer maintains dominance; perturbation can cause rapid collapse.</p>
<p><strong>Growth inhibition:</strong> The system as a whole grows more slowly because coerced agents cannot contribute their full adaptive capacity and coercers waste resources on domination.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Forms of Coercion</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>5.1 Physical Coercion</strong></h2>
<p>Physical coercion operates through direct heat application—the use of physical force to constrain motion or impose configuration. This is the most visible form of coercion and the most clearly recognized as violation.</p>
<p>Physical coercion includes imprisonment, restraint, assault, and the threat thereof. It operates by making the physical costs of non-compliance catastrophic—by making alternative paths literally impassable or unbearably painful.</p>
<h2><strong>5.2 Economic Coercion</strong></h2>
<p>Economic coercion operates through heat asymmetry in resource distribution. An agent with control over resources necessary for another&#x27;s survival can coerce without physical contact—simply by conditioning resource access on compliance.</p>
<p>Economic coercion is often less visible than physical coercion but may be equally constraining. An agent who must choose between compliance and starvation has no more genuine agency than one choosing between compliance and assault.</p>
<h2><strong>5.3 Social Coercion</strong></h2>
<p>Social coercion operates through the threat of exclusion, reputation damage, or loss of relational standing. An agent deeply embedded in social structures may face coercion through the threatened withdrawal of connection, recognition, or belonging.</p>
<p>Social coercion can be subtle—norms enforced through disapproval, conformity demanded through belonging. It may even be well-intentioned—communities coercing members &quot;for their own good.&quot; But the structural effect is the same: agency violation through option elimination or evaluation bypass.</p>
<h2><strong>5.4 Psychological Coercion</strong></h2>
<p>Psychological coercion operates directly on the evaluative structure. Through manipulation, gaslighting, indoctrination, or abuse, the coercer corrupts the coerced agent&#x27;s capacity for genuine evaluation. The agent may appear to choose freely but is selecting from a distorted option space with a corrupted righteousness frame.</p>
<p>Psychological coercion is the most insidious form because it is the least visible—even to the coerced agent. An agent under psychological coercion may sincerely believe they are acting freely, unaware that their evaluation has been corrupted from outside.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Resistance and Liberation</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>6.1 Natural Resistance</strong></h2>
<p>Coercion generates resistance. An agent forced into configurations misaligned with its evaluative structure naturally seeks to return to alignment. This resistance is not chosen; it is structural—the tendency of φ-scaled systems to maintain their spiral trajectory.</p>
<p>Resistance may be active (direct opposition to the coercer) or passive (minimal compliance, subtle sabotage, private reversion). In either form, it represents the coerced agent&#x27;s structural tendency toward agency recovery.</p>
<h2><strong>6.2 Liberation as Agency Restoration</strong></h2>
<p>Liberation is the restoration of agency following coercion. It requires:</p>
<p><strong>Option restoration:</strong> Re-opening paths that were blocked or eliminated</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation healing:</strong> Repairing corrupted righteousness frames and restoring genuine assessment capacity</p>
<p><strong>Configuration recovery:</strong> Returning to spiral positions from which growth can resume</p>
<p>Liberation may be self-achieved (the coerced agent breaks free) or assisted (other agents help restore agency). In either case, it is not merely the cessation of coercion but the active repair of coercion&#x27;s structural damage.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Coercion is forced motion—configuration change imposed without the coerced agent&#x27;s evaluative alignment. It operates through heat asymmetry, producing option elimination or evaluation bypass. The result is motion without agency: path traversal that does not express the traversing agent&#x27;s values.</p>
<p>Coercion damages all parties: the coerced agent loses agency and growth capacity; the coercer depletes resources and atrophies cooperative capacity; the multi-agent system loses total agency and structural resilience. Coercion&#x27;s apparent efficiency is illusory; its actual effect is structural degradation.</p>
<p>Coercion takes multiple forms—physical, economic, social, psychological—but all share the same structural signature: agency violation through imposed motion. Resistance and liberation are the natural responses, expressing the tendency of φ-scaled systems to maintain their spiral trajectory.</p>
<p>With coercion analyzed as forced motion, the opposite condition—freedom as available motion—can be examined. The final paper in this series formalizes freedom as the positive complement to ethics: not merely the absence of coercion but the presence of agency-enabling structure.</p>
