  <p class="subtitle">Agency and Choice — Constrained Selection</p>
  <h2><strong>1. Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>Agency is commonly treated as either a metaphysical primitive (free will) or an illusion to be explained away (determinism). Within the Motion Calendar, agency is neither. It is the structural capacity to select among available motions—a capacity that emerges necessarily from systems operating at sufficient entropic complexity.</p>
<p>This paper formalizes agency as constrained selection over ordered motion. An agent is a system that satisfies three conditions: it maintains identity through the golden spiral, it has access to multiple distinguishable paths forward, and it can differentially weight those paths through righteousness evaluation. Agency is not the absence of constraint; it is selection within constraint. The more structured the constraint, the more meaningful the agency.</p>
<p>Choice, correspondingly, is the actualization of one path among those available. A choice is real when multiple paths were genuinely accessible—when the configuration space admitted alternatives that were not taken. Determinism and freedom are revealed as compatible: the choice was determined by the system&#x27;s structure, yet the system genuinely selected from among real alternatives. What makes a choice free is not uncaused randomness but alignment between selection and evaluative identity.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Introduction — Agency Without Mystery</strong></h2>
<p>The question of agency has troubled philosophy since antiquity. If actions are caused by prior states, how can agents be responsible? If actions are uncaused, how can they be attributed to agents at all? The debate between determinism and libertarian free will has generated more heat than light, largely because both positions treat agency as all-or-nothing.</p>
<p>The Motion Calendar dissolves this dichotomy. Agency is not a binary property that a system either has or lacks. It is a graded capacity that emerges from structural complexity. Systems with sufficient organization across the divisor stages acquire the capacity to select among available motions. This capacity is real—it makes a difference to which path is taken. Yet it is also structured—it operates within constraints imposed by the motion functions.</p>
<p>The key insight is that selection requires structure. An undifferentiated field of heat has no agency because it has no distinguishable paths to select among. A fully rigid system has no agency because it has only one path available. Agency exists in the middle—in systems structured enough to have multiple distinguishable options, yet flexible enough to traverse different paths depending on internal evaluation.</p>
<p>This paper formalizes this insight. It defines agency as a structural property, identifies the conditions under which agency emerges, and shows how choice operates as constrained selection. The result is an account of agency that is neither mysteriously uncaused nor trivially illusory—but genuinely causal within the constraints of structured motion.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Conditions for Agency</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>3.1 Identity Maintenance</strong></h2>
<p>The first condition for agency is identity. An agent must be a system that maintains continuous existence through the golden spiral. Without identity, there is no subject to whom agency could be attributed—no persisting entity that could be said to choose.</p>
<p>This condition excludes momentary fluctuations, transient configurations, and dissipative processes from agency. A pattern that exists for an instant and then dissolves cannot be an agent, regardless of its complexity, because it lacks the temporal continuity required to select a path and traverse it.</p>
<p>Identity is necessary but not sufficient. Many systems maintain identity without exhibiting agency—crystals, orbits, static structures. These persist through the spiral but do not select among paths. Additional conditions are required.</p>
<h2><strong>3.2 Path Multiplicity</strong></h2>
<p>The second condition for agency is path multiplicity. The system must have access to more than one distinguishable future configuration. If only one path is structurally available, the system has no choice—it will traverse that path regardless of any internal process.</p>
<p>Path multiplicity is a function of configuration space topology. At each moment, a system occupies a position in configuration space. From that position, certain other positions are accessible (connected by entropy gradients and movement operators) and others are not. The set of accessible positions constitutes the system&#x27;s option space.</p>
<p>Agency requires that this option space contain at least two elements. Richer agency corresponds to larger option spaces—more paths, more configurations, more genuine alternatives. The most agentive systems have vast configuration spaces with many accessible paths from each position.</p>
<h2><strong>3.3 Differential Evaluation</strong></h2>
<p>The third condition for agency is differential evaluation. The system must be able to evaluate available paths differently—to distinguish them not merely as different but as better or worse relative to its righteousness frame.</p>
<p>This is where righteousness becomes essential. The righteousness function assigns alignment values to configurations relative to a relational frame. When applied to the option space, it produces a ranking (possibly partial) of available paths. Some paths align better with the system&#x27;s evaluative orientation; others align worse.</p>
<p>Without differential evaluation, path multiplicity would be meaningless. If all paths were equally aligned, selection among them would be arbitrary—random rather than agentive. Agency requires that the system care, in the precise sense that its righteousness frame distinguishes among options.</p>
<h2><strong>3.4 The Agency Triad</strong></h2>
<p>Agency requires all three conditions jointly:</p>
<p><strong>Identity:</strong> A persisting system to whom agency can be attributed</p>
<p><strong>Multiplicity:</strong> Multiple accessible paths among which to select</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Differential assessment of paths relative to a righteousness frame</p>
<p>A system lacking any one of these is not an agent. A system possessing all three is an agent to the degree that each condition is satisfied. Agency is graded: more persistent identity, richer path multiplicity, and finer differential evaluation all increase agentive capacity.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Choice as Path Selection</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>4.1 The Moment of Choice</strong></h2>
<p>A choice occurs when an agent transitions from a position with multiple accessible paths to one of those paths specifically. The moment of choice is the moment when multiplicity collapses into actuality—when the system commits to one trajectory and thereby forgoes others.</p>
<p>This moment is not outside time or outside causation. It occurs at a specific temporal index, and it is caused by the system&#x27;s configuration at that index. But causation here includes the system&#x27;s righteousness evaluation. The choice is caused by the system&#x27;s structure including its values—not despite them.</p>
<h2><strong>4.2 Selection Mechanism</strong></h2>
<p>How does selection occur? Not by random fluctuation, nor by external imposition, but by the interaction of three factors:</p>
<p><strong>Heat distribution:</strong> Paths with more allocated heat are more likely to be traversed. Magnitude matters.</p>
<p><strong>Righteousness alignment:</strong> Paths that better satisfy the system&#x27;s evaluative frame attract selection. Values matter.</p>
<p><strong>Entropic gradient:</strong> Paths along favorable entropy gradients require less reorganization. Ease matters.</p>
<p>The selected path is typically the one that best satisfies all three factors jointly. When factors conflict—when the most valued path is also the hardest or least energized—selection becomes genuinely difficult. This is experienced as conflict, deliberation, or struggle.</p>
<h2><strong>4.3 Freedom as Alignment</strong></h2>
<p>What makes a choice free? Not randomness—a random choice is arbitrary, not free. Not uncaused spontaneity—an uncaused event cannot be attributed to the agent. A choice is free when it expresses the agent&#x27;s evaluative identity.</p>
<p>Formally: a choice is free to the degree that the selected path aligns with the system&#x27;s righteousness frame. A choice that reflects the agent&#x27;s values is free. A choice that violates the agent&#x27;s values—made under compulsion, deception, or malfunction—is unfree.</p>
<p>This definition dissolves the apparent conflict between determinism and freedom. The choice is determined—caused by the system&#x27;s structure. Yet it is also free—expressive of the system&#x27;s values. Determination by one&#x27;s own values is not opposed to freedom; it is the definition of freedom.</p>
<h2><strong>4.4 Degrees of Freedom</strong></h2>
<p>Freedom, like agency, is graded. A choice made under severe constraint, with few options, is less free than a choice made with many options—even if both express the agent&#x27;s values. A choice made with full access to information is more free than a choice made in ignorance—even if both align with the same evaluative frame.</p>
<p>Maximum freedom corresponds to maximum agency: persistent identity, rich path multiplicity, fine-grained evaluation, and full alignment between selection and value. Minimum freedom (unfreedom) corresponds to minimal agency: constrained identity, single paths, indifferent evaluation, or misalignment between selection and value.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Responsibility and Attribution</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>5.1 Attribution Conditions</strong></h2>
<p>When is an agent responsible for a choice? The Motion Calendar provides clear conditions: responsibility obtains when the choice was made by an agent satisfying the agency triad, when the selected path was genuinely among the options available, and when the selection reflected the agent&#x27;s righteousness evaluation.</p>
<p>These conditions rule out several excusing situations:</p>
<p><strong>No identity:</strong> If the system was not maintaining coherent identity at the moment of choice, there is no persisting agent to hold responsible.</p>
<p><strong>No alternatives:</strong> If only one path was accessible, the system had no choice; responsibility is diminished or absent.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation failure:</strong> If the selection did not reflect the agent&#x27;s righteousness frame (due to deception, compulsion, or malfunction), the choice was not truly the agent&#x27;s.</p>
<h2><strong>5.2 Degrees of Responsibility</strong></h2>
<p>Responsibility, like freedom, is graded. Full responsibility obtains when all conditions are fully satisfied. Partial responsibility obtains when conditions are partially satisfied—when options were limited, when information was incomplete, when values were unclear.</p>
<p>This graded view accords with moral intuition. We hold agents more responsible for choices made with clear options, full information, and explicit values. We hold them less responsible for choices made under constraint, ignorance, or confusion. The Motion Calendar provides the structural basis for these intuitions.</p>
<h2><strong>5.3 Self-Responsibility</strong></h2>
<p>An agent is responsible not only for individual choices but for its own structure—for the righteousness frame that guides selection, for the configuration space it has developed through learning, for the identity it maintains through the spiral.</p>
<p>This recursive responsibility is essential. An agent that chooses badly may excuse any single choice by pointing to its values at the moment of choice. But the agent is also responsible for having those values—for the prior choices that shaped its evaluative frame. Responsibility extends backward through the spiral, encompassing the entire trajectory that produced the current structure.</p>
<h2><strong>6. The Spectrum of Agency</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>6.1 Minimal Agency</strong></h2>
<p>At the lower end of the spectrum, minimal agency consists of bare identity maintenance with binary path choice and coarse evaluation. A thermostat exhibits minimal agency: it maintains a simple identity, chooses between heating and not-heating, and evaluates based on a single threshold.</p>
<p>Minimal agents are real agents—they satisfy the agency triad. But their agency is impoverished. Few options, crude evaluation, simple identity. They are agents in the technical sense but not in the rich sense that characterizes complex living systems.</p>
<h2><strong>6.2 Rich Agency</strong></h2>
<p>At the upper end of the spectrum, rich agency consists of robust identity maintained through extensive learning, vast configuration spaces with many accessible paths, and fine-grained multi-dimensional evaluation across complex righteousness frames.</p>
<p>Rich agents can deliberate—consider multiple paths, evaluate them against multiple criteria, weigh competing values. They can project—model future configurations and evaluate them before committing. They can reflect—evaluate their own evaluative frames and modify them through learning.</p>
<p>Human beings, at their best, exhibit rich agency. So do other complex systems with sufficient structural organization. Rich agency is not uniquely human; it is a structural achievement open to any system that develops sufficient complexity across the motion functions.</p>
<h2><strong>6.3 Consciousness and Agency</strong></h2>
<p>Where does consciousness fit? Within the Motion Calendar, consciousness is defined as agency directed toward the self—a system that satisfies the agency triad with respect to its own structure. A conscious system not only selects paths through external configuration space; it selects paths through its own internal configuration.</p>
<p>This makes consciousness a special case of agency rather than a separate phenomenon. Consciousness requires the agency triad applied reflexively: identity that includes self-reference, multiplicity of internal paths, and evaluation of those paths against an internal righteousness frame.</p>
<p>Consciousness is therefore graded like agency. Systems with minimal self-directed agency are minimally conscious. Systems with rich self-directed agency are richly conscious. The spectrum of consciousness follows the spectrum of reflexive agency.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Agency, within the Motion Calendar, is the structural capacity to select among available motions. It requires three conditions: identity maintenance through the golden spiral, access to multiple distinguishable paths, and differential evaluation via righteousness. Systems satisfying these conditions are agents; the degree to which they satisfy them determines the richness of their agency.</p>
<p>Choice is the actualization of one path among those available. A choice is free when it aligns with the agent&#x27;s evaluative identity. Freedom and determinism are compatible: the choice is caused by the agent&#x27;s structure including its values, and this is precisely what makes it free rather than arbitrary.</p>
<p>Responsibility follows from agency. An agent is responsible for choices made while satisfying the agency triad, to the degree that alternatives were genuinely available and selection genuinely reflected evaluation. Responsibility extends recursively to the agent&#x27;s own structure—to the values that guide selection.</p>
<p>With learning, identity, and agency established, one phenomenon remains unexplained: how do systems improve? Learning reorganizes entropy; identity persists through reorganization; agency selects among paths. But what drives the selection toward better configurations rather than worse? The answer requires an account of error, correction, and growth—the subject of the next paper.</p>
